The input file is called 'inputfile'
There are two more files in the wc_output folder. They're called 'OutputStream.txt' and 'OutputStream2.txt'. They're there because
they're the resulting file made when all files in wc_input folder are combined for the two programs.

The run.sh file runs if I use ‘bash run.sh’ as the command in Terminal.
It doesn’t run when I use ‘./run.sh’ even though I have made the file executable using the chmod command.
